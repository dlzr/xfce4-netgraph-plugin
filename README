What is it?
===========

This is a plugin for the XFCE panel that shows a graph of the recent network
traffic, similar to the CPU Graph plugin.  Yes, there are many other similar
plugins out there, but this one is slightly different:

 * It displays the upload traffic separately from the download traffic (upload
   is on top, download on the bottom).

 * It automatically adjusts the scale of the chart, so you can always see
   what's going on (even if there's very little traffic, it gets zoomed-in).
   The tooltip tells you what the current scale is.

 * It monitors *all* network interfaces automatically (as in, you don't have to
   specify which interface you want monitored, so when you plug in a network
   cable and all the traffic switches over from WiFi, you don't have to
   reconfigure the plugin).  But if you want to monitor a single interface (or
   a specific set of interfaces), you can still do that.

 * It's fairly configurable.
